Rectangular Waveguide Field Analysis

This project investigates electromagnetic field behavior in rectangular waveguides, a key component in microwave and RF engineering. Using ANSYS HFSS, it visualizes transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes, analyzing electric and magnetic field distributions across XY, XZ, and YZ planes. The study also examines surface current density along waveguide walls, providing insights into wave-structure interactions. The results help optimize waveguide design, dimensions, and operating frequencies for efficient, distortion-free signal transmission in applications such as satellite communications, radar, and advanced sensing systems.

Objective:

Analyze TEmn and TMmn modes within a rectangular waveguide.

Visualize field patterns across different planes and frequency bands.

Study surface current density to understand energy propagation and waveguide performance.

Simulation Procedure Highlights:

Define frequency sweep (e.g., 8â€“12 GHz) in ANSYS HFSS.

Set waveguide excitation and modes (dominant TE10 by default).

Select field type: electric, magnetic, or surface current.

Ensure proper mode excitation via waveguide dimensions and operating frequency.

Visualize field patterns across XY, XZ, and YZ planes.
